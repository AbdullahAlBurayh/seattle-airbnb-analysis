## Introduction
This project analyzes the Seattle Airbnb Open Data to uncover insights and answer key business questions. The goal is to explore various aspects of Airbnb listings in Seattle, such as pricing, customer reviews, and neighborhood popularity.

## Datasets
We used three main datasets:
- **Calendar Data**: Contains availability and pricing information for listings.
- **Listings Data**: Provides detailed information about each Airbnb listing, including descriptions, host details, and amenities.
- **Reviews Data**: Includes customer reviews and ratings for listings.

## Questions Explored
1. What factors most influence the price of an Airbnb listing in Seattle?
2. How do customer reviews and ratings correlate with the success of an Airbnb listing?
3. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are the most popular for Airbnb rentals, and how do their prices and reviews compare?

## Results
The analysis highlights that location is a crucial factor in determining the price of Airbnb listings in Seattle. While higher prices may lead to fewer reviews, the quality of reviews (ratings) is not significantly affected by the price.
